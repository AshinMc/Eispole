# eispole

Our Operating Systems flutter project

## THE APP

This project is a flutter app for a cute little ice cream cafe.
This project is the result of a few friends actually thinking of opening an ice cream business and then thinking about using the same idea for our operating systems project.
You might wonder where the name of the app Eispole comes from and to be completely honest i couldn't tell you. Its Completely random
The app will allow users to pick between the 7 available flavours, namely Vanilla, Chocolate, Butterscotch, Stracciatella, Cookies, Mango and Bubble Gum, the users shall be able to see how much they owe for their order and they will be assigned an order number.
After placing the order and recieving the order number they can take the app to the kiosk and pay for the ice cream.(Cash only)
